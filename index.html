        <h2>Seven Steps To Better Code, Faster</h2>
        <p>The time developers need to write software, is <strong>the</strong> number 1 bottleneck in any firm that creates software. Creating your apps and websites out of reusable components can go a long way to helping with that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ninecol last">
        <h3>Phix Takes Care Of The Infrastructure For Components</h3>
        <p>
        <p>Use <code>phix</code> to:
        <ul>
          <li>Create components written in PHP</li>
          <li>Review the quality of the code in your components</li>
          <li>Document the code in your components</li>
          <li>Build a package that can be installed by the PEAR Installer</li>
          <li>Publish your packages</li>
          <li>Reuse your components, and components written by others</li>
          <li>Upgrade your component's skeleton files</li>
        </ul>
        <p>... so that you can spend your time focusing on code, not the infrastructure of your component.</p>
        <h3>Create Components For PHP</h3>
        <p>Creating a new component from scratch is a one-line command:</p>
        <pre>
# create a new PHP component in the current folder
$ phix php-library:init .
</pre>
        <p>This gives you a complete folder structure - the same one used by <code>phix</code> itself - for you to put your code and tests into.</p>
        <h3>Review The Code In Those Components</h3>
        <p>Want to run your unit tests, and have them generate code-coverage and code-quality metrics? That's all done in a one-line command:</p>
        <pre>
# run your component's unit tests
$ phing test
</pre>
        <p>And, once your unit tests all pass, if you want additional code quality information, that's also a one-line command:</p>
        <pre>
# generate code-review information
$ phing code-review
</pre>
        <h3>Document The Code In Your Components</h3>
        <p>Are you using document comment blocks in your code? You can turn those into a browsable website with a one-line command:</p>
        <pre>
# generate API documentation from your PHP code
$ phing phpdoc
</pre>
        <h3>Build A Component That's PEAR-Installer Compatible</h3>
        <p>When you're happy with your component, and you want to package it up, that's a one-line command:</p>
        <pre>
# create a PEAR-compatible package from your component
$ phing pear-package
</pre>
        <h3>Publish Your Component</h3>
        <p>When you're ready to share your package with others, it's just a one-line command to add your package to your existing PEAR channel, if you're using <a href="http://www.pirum-project.org">Pirum</a> for creating your PEAR channel:</p>
        <pre>
# publish your PEAR package to your local checkout of your PEAR channel
$ phing publish-local
</pre>
        <h3>Reuse Your Components - And The Components Of Others</h3>
        <p>Want to reuse your component in another project? No more cut &amp; paste, no more <code>svn:externals</code>. Make that project a component too, and add your component as a required dependency in the project's package.xml file.</p>
        <p>And because <code>package.xml</code> is a standard part of a PEAR package, your project can also reuse any third-party components that are also PEAR-Installer compatible.</p>
        <p>Reusing your components is where the real payoff is - so you spend less time re-inventing the wheel, and more time focusing on what's unique to your app.</p>
        <h3>Upgrade Your Component's Skeleton Files</h3>
        <p>At the heart of your component are the skeleton files that automate all of the tasks above.  Maintaining these skeleton files by hand would be a chore, but with <code>phix</code>, they can be upgraded with a one-line command:</pre>
        <pre>
# upgrade the skeleton files
$ phix php-library:upgrade .
</pre>
        <p>And best of all ... your component is self-contained. Happy with the component as it is?  You don't need to upgrade the skeleton files, which means your components don't break just because you've installed a newer version of <code>phix</code> on your computer.</p>
        <h3>Do It Your Way</h3>
        <p>Want to go futher than <code>phix</code> does, and automate additional tasks that are unique to your working style or environment?  Just put those tasks in <code>build.local.xml</code>, and <code>phix</code> will never overwrite them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="threecol">
        <h2>Framework Agnostic</h2>
        <p>If you're building an app, chances are you're working with a framework of some sort. One day, you'll need to change framework. If all of your code is tied to that framework, change will be very very expensive indeed.</p>
        <p>By moving as much of your code as is sensible into their own components, you'll be well-prepared for when that day comes.</p>

      <div class="ninecol last">
        <h3>Glueing The Best Tools Together</h3>
        <p><code>phix</code> aims to be the glue that brings the best of the community's existing PHP tools together in an easy-to-use way, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR Installer</a>, the standard tool for packaging and installing PHP components</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a>, the de facto standard way to unit test your PHP code</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.pirum-project.org">Pirum</a>, the easiest way to create your own PEAR channel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wherever possible, <code>phix</code> will add support alternative tools, so that you can choose the ones that you prefer.</p>

SYNOPSIS
    /usr/bin/phix [ -? -d -h -v ] [ --? --debug --help --version ] [ -I &lt;path&gt;
     ] [ --include=&lt;path&gt; ] [ command ] [ command-options ]

OPTIONS
    Use the following switches in front of any &lt;command&gt; to have the following
    effects.

    -? | -h
        display a summary of the command-line structure

    -I &lt;path&gt; | --include=&lt;path&gt;
        add a folder to load commands from

        phix finds all of its commands by searching PHP's include_path for PHP
        files in folders called 'PhixCommands'. If you want to phix to look in
        other folders without having to add them to PHP's include_path, use
        --include to tell phix to look in these folders.

        phix expects '&lt;path&gt;' to point to a folder that conforms to the PSR0
        standard for autoloaders.

        For example, if your command is the class '\Me\Tools\PhixCommands
        \ScheduledTask', phix would expect to autoload this class from the 'Me
        /Tools/PhixCommands/ScheduledTask.php' file.

        If your class lives in the './myApp/lib/Me/Tools/PhixCommands' folder,
        you would call phix with 'phix --include=./myApp/lib'

    -d | --debug
        enable debugging output

    -v | --version
        display phix version number

    --? | --help
        display a full list of supported commands

        <h2>Phix Is Written For PHP 5.3</h2>
        <p>Phix takes advantage of new features in PHP 5.3 to keep code quality up, and code size down.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ninecol last">
        <h3>Minimal Requirements</h3>
        <p><code>phix</code> is a command-line (CLI) tool, which you run from a <strong>Terminal</strong> or <strong>CMD</strong> window. You don't need a web browser or a web server to use <code>phix</code>. You would normally install <code>phix</code> onto your development desktop, laptop or virtual machine; you wouldn't normally install <code>phix</code> into your production environment.</p>
        <p>Before you install <code>phix</code>, you will need an operating system with PHP 5.3 or later installed. Our one-line installer will take care of the additional requirements.</p>
        <p><span class="label notice">Hint</span> Apple OSX Lion users might find <a href="http://akrabat.com/php/setting-up-php-mysql-on-os-x-10-7-lion/">Rob Allen's instructions for setting up PHP on OSX 10.7 Lion</a> very useful.</p>
        <p>If we don't have a one-line installer for your operating system yet, we also provide full instructions for installing from source.</p>

          <h2>Phix Was Built To Be Extensible</h2>
          <p>At the heart of <code>phix</code> is a generic CLI tool, which you can add your own commands to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ninecol last">
          <h3>Looking At The Structure Of Phix</h3>
          <p>When you install <code>phix/phix4componentdev</code>, this is a meta-package that asks the PEAR installer to install:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>phix</code>, which is a generic command-line tool, and</li>
            <li><code>ComponentManager</code>, which adds a set of commands to <code>phix</code> for creating and maintaining PHP components</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each of the <code>phix</code> commands is implemented in its own PHP class:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>that lives inside the <code>PhixCommands</code> namespace,</li>
            <li>that implements the <code>Phix_Project\PhixExtensions\CommandInterface</code>, and</li>
            <li>that extends <code>Phix_Project\PhixExtensions\CommandBase</code>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><code>phix4componentdev</code> is just an extension to <code>phix</code> that provides the commands for creating and maintaining PHP components.</p>
          <h3>Extending Phix With Your Own Commands</h3>
          <p><code>phix</code> was built to be extensible, for you to be able to drop your own commands in via your own components.</p>
          <p>The best place to start is by looking at the <a href="http://github.com/stuartherbert/ComponentManagerPhpLibrary">ComponentManagerPhpLibrary</a> component on GitHub.  This component provides the <code>phix php-library:*</code> commands that you use to create a new PHP component.</p>
          <p>You'll also find <a href="http://github.com/stuartherbert/TasksLib">TasksLib</a> useful. It is a small, but growing, set of automated tasks - with full error and exception handling - specifically designed to save each new <code>phix</code> command having to duplicate common functionality.</p>
